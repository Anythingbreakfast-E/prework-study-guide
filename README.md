# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Created in the need to students needing to organize and access notes throughout the bootcamp course. Contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Use this as a one-point access point to find notes on the subject of Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The bullet points are not in any specific order but highlight important notes of each subject. If you open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. We have created this using math. and randommath. and it lists the topics we learned from prework and chooses one topic for us to study first. For suggestions, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. You will see a list of topics and there it will display which subject to start with.
